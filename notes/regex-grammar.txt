character class ideas:
1. Alternatives
    - add a single "range" or "interval" state
    - merge and sort from the class during parsing, i.e.:
        [a-zde0-53-934]
        [a-h d e 0-5 3-9 3 4]
        [a-h 0-9]
        [a-z0-9]
    - if a negated class, invert the above merged and sorted interval list
    - create a machine from the list of intervals as branching machines of range
      and symbol states
    - PROS: simulation logic only needs to consider single range or symbol at a time
    - CONS: potentially many more states, for alphabet a-z,
        [^a] would then create 25 symbol states and 24 branching states

2. Single State
    - list of merged and sorted intervals directly on the state
    - PROS: single state
    - CONS: simulation logic is more complex, requires a loop


ERROR HANDLING

Computing the "next" set of tokens based on parser state:

In a table-driven parser I'd use a stack and parsing a sub-expression would look like this:

"("

')' EXPR '('        NEXT = FIRST('(')                               '(' is not nullable, so I don't need to consider the rest of the stack
')' EXPR            NEXT = FIRST(EXPR) ∪ FIRST(')')                 EXPR is nullable, so I need to consider the next grammar symbol
')' ALTS ALT        NEXT = FIRST(ALT) ∪ FIRST(ALTS) ∪ FIRST(')')    ALT and ALTS are nullable, so I need to consider the next grammar symbols
')' ALTS            NEXT = FIRST(ALTS) ∪ FIRST(')')                 ALTS is nullable, so I need to consider the next grammar symbol
')'                 NEXT = FIRST(')')                               ')' is not nullable, so I don't need to consider the rest of the stack

"(a"

')' EXPR '('              NEXT = FIRST('(')                               '(' is not nullable, so I don't need to consider the rest of the stack
')' EXPR                  NEXT = FIRST(EXPR) ∪ FIRST(')')                 EXPR is nullable, so I need to consider the next grammar symbol
')' ALTS ALT              NEXT = FIRST(ALT) ∪ FIRST(ALTS) ∪ FIRST(')')    ALT and ALTS are nullable, so I need to consider the next grammar symbols
')' ALTS FACTORS FACTOR   NEXT = FIRST(FACTOR) ∪ FIRST(FACTORS) ∪ FIRST(ALTS) ∪ FIRST(')')    " "
    = { '(' '{a' '[' '[^' '.' 'a' '|' ')' }

The KEY THING is computing FIRST(current state of the parser stack)



(a      REGEX                                                   {
(a      EXPR EOF
(a      ALT ALTS EOF
(a      FACTOR FACTORS ALTS EOF
(a      lparen EXPR rparen UNOPS FACTORS ALTS EOF
a       lparen EXPR rparen UNOPS FACTORS ALTS EOF
a       lparen ALT ALTS rparen UNOPS FACTORS ALTS EOF
a       lparen FACTOR FACTORS ALTS rparen UNOPS FACTORS ALTS EOF
a       lparen a FACTORS ALTS rparen UNOPS FACTORS ALTS EOF
        lparen a ALTS rparen UNOPS FACTORS ALTS EOF
        lparen a rparen UNOPS FACTORS ALTS EOF


TODO: return computation descriptors from expect, peek, and the non-terminal
routines and implement an "&&" combinator that merges two descriptors

This will give me the ability to construct the "next" set of possible tokens on the fly

This could also be used to construct a parse table on the fly

For example:
sub_desc = then(then(expect(LPAREN_T), expect(EXPR_NT)), expect(RPAREN_T))
if (parse(input, sub_desc)) { good() } else { bad(desc.error) }

primitives:
peek
expect

combinators:
then

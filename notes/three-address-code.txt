Three Address Code

addresses are:
- name
- constant
- a temporary

where x, y, z are addresses
where L represents a label:
where relop is a relational operator like == or >=

assignment              x = y op z
unary assignment        x = op y
copy                    x = y
indexed copy            x = y[i], x[i] = y
address/pointer         x = &y, x = *y, *x = y
unconditional jump      goto L
conditional jump        if x goto L, ifFalse x goto L
                        if x relop y goto L
procedure calls         param x
                        call p n, y = call p, n
                        return y

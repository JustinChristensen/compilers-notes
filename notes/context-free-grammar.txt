Context Free Grammar Properties/Notes/Etc

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context-free_grammar

A formal grammar that is "context free" in the sense that it's production rules can be applied regardless of the
context of a given nonterminal. That is,

aBc     iBk         B

The non-terminal B derives the same language regardless of which symbols, a, c, i, and k, surround it.

This stands in opposition to a "Context-Sensitive Grammar"

Derivations:

LL (Left to Right, Leftmost Derivation)
LR (Left to Right, Rightmost Derivation)

Suitability for parsing:
